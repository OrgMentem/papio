# Changelog — browser extension

All notable changes to the *papio* browser extension (Chrome/Firefox MV3,
`extension/`) are documented here. The extension is versioned and released
independently of the daemon: its version lives in `extension/manifest.json`
(and must match `extension/package.json`), and a release is cut with an
`ext-v<version>` tag. Daemon/CLI changes live in the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

A change that spans the native-messaging protocol appears in **both**
changelogs — each file describes the behavior change visible to users of that
artifact.

History before 0.3.1 was recorded in the root `CHANGELOG.md` (the extension
and daemon shared a version stream through 0.3.0); see its `[0.3.0]` section
for the full pre-split extension history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Acquire this page**: a popup button (shown only when the connected daemon
  advertises the `page_acquire` feature) reads the current tab's
  `citation_doi` metadata under the activeTab grant and asks the daemon to
  acquire the paper; pages without a DOI show "no DOI found on this page"
  and send nothing.
- Adapters can declare `requiresVisible`; their handoff tabs then open in a
  normal, unfocused window instead of the minimized work window (fix path
  for providers that under-render while hidden). No current adapter sets it.

### Fixed

- The developer-only fixture-capture tool no longer leaks its filename
  reservation when Chrome rejects a download; unclaimed reservations expire
  after one minute.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-19

First version submitted to Firefox Add-ons (AMO, listed channel). Chrome Web
Store carries 0.3.0 — the cross-store skew is intentional; the listings are
independent.

### Fixed

- The developer-only "Capture fixture" panel in the popup no longer ships to
  store users: it is gated on
  `chrome.management.getSelf().installType === "development"` and appears only
  for unpacked/dev installs.
- The manifest `description` was shortened to fit the Chrome Web Store's
  132-character summary limit (an over-limit summary blocks the store upload;
  `web-ext lint` does not catch it).
- `extension/package.json` version brought back in sync with
  `extension/manifest.json` (the compat preflight in CI enforces they match).

### Changed

- *papio* is now italicised in the extension's own UI, matching the
  product-wide brand convention: a `renderPapio` helper (`src/dom.ts`) wraps
  the wordmark in `<em>` across the popup (daemon status, resolver lede), the
  options page (consent, work-window, and daemon-footer status lines), and the
  static popup/options HTML.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

First store-submitted version (Chrome Web Store). Shared a version stream with
daemon v0.3.0 — see the root `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]` section for the complete
extension changes (library-resolver access grants, daemon version-skew
surfaces, Firefox support, background work window, store submission tooling).
